Python is a really handy tool for these kind of situations, as it is possible to read data from (basically) any kind of input datafile (such as csv-, txt-, excel-, gpx-files (gps data), databases etc.). \n","\n","Let's see how we can read data from a file and create Point -objects from them. Later on in the course, we will learn how to write the data in various GIS file formats (including Shapefiles and geopackages). \n","\n","Our dataset **[travelTimes_2015_Helsinki.txt](data/travelTimes_2015_Helsinki.txt)** consist of \n","travel times between specific locations in Helsinki Region. The file is located in the `data` folder in this exercise repository. The first four rows of our data look like this:\n","\n","```\n","   from_id;to_id;fromid_toid;route_number;at;from_x;from_y;to_x;to_y;total_route_time;route_time;route_distance\n","
